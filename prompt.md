Create a typescript class representing a 2D matrix with values of '*' and '.', each row representing a layer at a certain depth of a terrain. The class must allow for a state change per cycle, in which some elements are updated. The updating rule is that '*'-cells bordering with at least one '.'-cell in the same row become '.' as well. The update is triggered on class instances using nextDay(). The class maintains a cycle counter update each time this nextDay is called. The class has a getter 'isCollapsing' which returns true if there is one column in the terrain matrix with a '*' value in the top row, and '.' in all others. In the constructor, add a test to see whether all strings in the input have the same length, and return an error if not. Make sure the constructor accepts the rows as strings containing '*' and '.', and the matrix row is generated using .split(). This allows the user to enter the rows as strings and not as an array of strings.
